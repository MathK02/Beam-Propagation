# Beam-Propagation
Beam propagation simulation with Zernike correction using FFT

This repository contains a MATLAB script for simulating the propagation of a beam through a pupil corrected with Zernike polynomials. The simulation considers varying wavelengths and computes the Point Spread Function (PSF) at different propagation distances. Key features include:

Simulation of beam propagation in 2D space.
Application of Zernike polynomials for pupil correction.
Use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient propagation.
Calculation of spot radius and best focus position.
